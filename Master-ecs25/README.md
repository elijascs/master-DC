# Production and Characterization of LgtB Glycosyltransferase Variants from *Neisseria meningitidis*
Elijas Christoph Schüz

This GitHub repository contains the Python scripts for data evaluation and figure creation for my master thesis.

## Contents

### FPLC
The folder contains Python scripts for direct data visualization of ÄKTA Pure (GE) excel (xlsx) data output files. Various scripts describe the visualization of one or multiple meaurements and with one or two different measured wavelength.

### Fluoro
This collection reveals the Python scripts in visualization for fluorescence data measured with the infinite M200 Pro spectrophotometer (Tecan). The emission and excitation spectra compare the measurements between two sample groups (crude cell extract and supernantant) among three different enzyme constructs. The statistics script evaluates and visualizes the fluorescence values between different measurements. The files are presented as .ipynb.

### pH assay
The presented files in this folder offer scripts for primary data visualization of absorbance measurments with the infinite M200 Pro spectrophotometer (Tecan) and after preparation of respective excel files. Primary data were plotted over time between various types of measurements with UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal donor.  Furthermore, the files reveal scripts for presenting the relative changes (in %) in the absorbance measurements over a defined period. "Activity&Calibration" offers data evaluation after converting absorbance data with the help of the calibration curve into proton production rate (PPR).

## Aids
The respective Python scripts were partly tuned with the help of ChatGPT/JetBrains AI assistent.
